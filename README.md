This is an AI image generator discord bot written in Python.

Image providers:
- Imaginepy
- Stable Horde
- Pollination

Stable Horde Models:
- Stable Diffusion
- Anything Diffusion

All of these are online providers.
As a result, you will not need a powerful computer!

## Prerequisites
This project assumes that:
- Python 3.8+ is installed and is on your PATH
- Pip is installed
- Git is installed
- You know how to create a Discord Bot account


## Setup
1. Create a Discord Bot and grab the token. Make sure to switch on Message Content Intent in the `Bot` tab of the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Grab an API key from Stable Horde [at their register page](https://stablehorde.net/register).
3. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and place your bot token and your API key in. It should look something like this:
```
API_KEY=0000000000
BOT_TOKEN=abc132
```
2. Get a bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and place it in `bot_token.txt`.
Make sure to switch on Message Content Intent in the Bot tab of the Developer Portal.
3. Clone the Stable Horde CLI repository:
```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-CLI' --depth=1
```
4. Create venv and install dependencies:

Linux or MacOS
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows
```shell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the bot and invite it with the link it provides.
6. Type / in the message box and start messing around with the commands!


## Generate images faster
Stable Horde uses Kudos to rank users on a queue. The more Kudos you have, the higher you are on the generation queue.
You get Kudos by rating images and/or generating images for Stable Horde
on your local hardware.
To get more Kudos, first stick your api key [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/settings).
Then, rate some images generated by other users [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/rate).
After rating for a few minutes, you will have more Kudos!
**IMPORTANT: When an image says, "This rating must be x," you must rate it that. This picture is used as a Captcha to avoid spam.**
