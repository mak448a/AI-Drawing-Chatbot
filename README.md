This is a stable diffusion Bot written in Python. It uses Stable Horde to generate the images.
As a result, you will not need a powerful computer!
All generated images will be sent back to LAION to train Stable Diffusion. If you don't want this, get an api key from [here](https://stablehorde.net/register) and place it in `api_key.txt`. Please note that your prompts are still sent to Stable Horde, as listed in their [privacy policy](https://stablehorde.net/privacy).


## Prerequisites
This project assumes that:
- Python 3.8+ is installed and on your path variable
- Pip is installed
- Git is installed
- You know how to create a Discord Bot account


## Setup

1. Get an API key from Stable Horde [at their register page](https://stablehorde.net/register) and place it in `api_key.txt`.
2. Get a bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and place it in `bot_token.txt`.
3. Clone the Stable Horde CLI repository:
```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/mak448a/AI-Horde-With-Cli' --depth=1
```
4: Install dependencies:

Linux or MacOS
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows
```shell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Generate images faster
Stable Horde uses Kudos to rank users on a queue. The more Kudos you have, the higher you are on the generation queue.
You get Kudos by rating images and/or generating images for Stable Horde
on your local hardware.
To get more Kudos, first stick your api key [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/settings).
Then, rate some images generated by other users [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/rate).
After rating for a few minutes, you will have more Kudos!
**IMPORTANT: When an image says, "This rating must be x," you must rate it that. This picture is used as a Captcha to avoid spam.**
